# MLB Stats MCP Server

A Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that provides comprehensive MLB baseball statistics with video highlights through the [pybaseball](https://github.com/jldbc/pybaseball) library.

## Overview

This MCP server enables AI assistants to access real-time MLB statistics, historical data, and video highlights. It provides four powerful tools for querying baseball data, from individual player performance to team statistics and advanced Statcast metrics.

## Features

### üéØ 4 Core Tools

#### 1. `get_player_stats`
Get detailed Statcast data for any MLB player with optional date filtering.
- **Parameters:**
  - `name` (required): Player name (e.g., "Mike Trout", "Ronald Acu√±a Jr.")
  - `start_date` (optional): Start date in YYYY-MM-DD format
  - `end_date` (optional): End date in YYYY-MM-DD format
- **Returns:** Player statistics including hits, home runs, exit velocity, launch angle, and barrel rate

#### 2. `get_team_stats`
Retrieve comprehensive team batting or pitching statistics for any season.
- **Parameters:**
  - `team` (required): Team name or abbreviation (e.g., "Yankees", "NYY", "Red Sox")
  - `year` (required): Season year (1871-present)
  - `stat_type` (optional): "batting" (default) or "pitching"

#### 4. `statcast_leaderboard`
Query advanced Statcast data with filtering, sorting, and video highlight links.
- **Parameters:**
  - `start_date` (required): Start date in YYYY-MM-DD format
  - `end_date` (required): End date in YYYY-MM-DD format
  - `result` (optional): Filter by outcome (e.g., "home_run", "single", "double")
  - `min_ev` (optional): Minimum exit velocity filter
  - `min_pitch_velo` (optional): Minimum pitch velocity filter
  - `sort_by` (optional): Sort metric:
    - `"exit_velocity"` (default) - Hardest hit balls
    - `"distance"` - Longest hits
    - `"launch_angle"` - Optimal launch angles
    - `"pitch_velocity"` - Fastest pitches
    - `"spin_rate"` - Highest spin rates
    - `"xba"` - Highest expected batting average
    - `"xwoba"` - Highest expected weighted on-base average
    - `"barrel"` - Barrel rate (perfect contact)
  - `limit` (optional): Number of results (default: 10)

  - `group_by` (optional): Group results by "team" for team-wide rankings
- **Returns:** Detailed play-by-play data with video links (or team aggregations when group_by="team")

### üé• Video Highlights Integration

Every result from `statcast_leaderboard` includes detailed metrics and video access points:

```json

  "date": "2024-07-20",
  "exit_velocity": 113.7,
  "launch_angle": 23.0,
  "distance": 456.0,
  "result": "home_run",
  "pitch_velocity": 95.2,
  "pitch_type": "FF",
  "spin_rate": 2450,
  "xba": 0.920,
  "xwoba": 1.823,
  "barrel": true,
  "description": "Ronald Acu√±a Jr. homers (13) on a fly ball to center field.",
  "video_links": {
    "game_highlights_url": "https://www.mlb.com/gameday/745890/video",
    "film_room_search": "https://www.mlb.com/video/search?q=Ronald+Acuna+Jr.+2024-07-20",
    "game_pk": "745890",
    "api_highlights_endpoint": "https://statsapi.mlb.com/api/v1/schedule?gamePk=745890&hydrate=game(content(highlights(highlights)))"
  }
}
```

### üèüÔ∏è Smart Team Recognition

The server intelligently handles team names:
- Full names: "Orioles" ‚Üí "BAL", "Red Sox" ‚Üí "BOS"
- Cities: "Boston" ‚Üí "BOS", "New York Yankees" ‚Üí "NYY"
- Historical teams: "Expos" ‚Üí "MON", "Indians" ‚Üí "CLE"
- All 30 current MLB teams supported with common variations

### üìä Team-Wide Rankings

New team aggregation feature for `statcast_leaderboard`:
- Group results by team to see team-wide performance
- Calculates averages, maximums, and counts for each metric
- Perfect for questions like "Which team hits the hardest home runs?"
- Returns comprehensive team statistics including barrel counts and expected metrics

# MLB Stats MCP Server

A Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that provides comprehensive MLB baseball statistics with video highlights through the [pybaseball](https://github.com/jldbc/pybaseball) library.

## Overview

This MCP server enables AI assistants to access real-time MLB statistics, historical data, and video highlights. It provides four powerful tools for querying baseball data, from individual player performance to team statistics and advanced Statcast metrics.

## Features

### üéØ 4 Core Tools

#### 1. `get_player_stats`

  - `start_date` (optional): Start date in YYYY-MM-DD format
  - `end_date` (optional): End date in YYYY-MM-DD format
- **Returns:** Player statistics including hits, home runs, exit velocity, launch angle, and barrel rate

#### 2. `get_team_stats`
Retrieve comprehensive team batting or pitching statistics for any season.
- **Parameters:**
  - `team` (required): Team name or abbreviation (e.g., "Yankees", "NYY", "Red Sox")
  - `year` (required): Season year (1871-present)
  - `stat_type` (optional): "batting" (default) or "pitching"
- **Returns:** Complete team statistics for the specified season

#### 3. `get_leaderboard`
Access statistical leaderboards for any MLB stat category.
- **Parameters:**

  - `season` (required): Season year
  - `leaderboard_type` (optional): "batting" or "pitching"
  - `limit` (optional): Number of results (default: 10)
- **Returns:** Top players for the specified statistic

#### 4. `statcast_leaderboard`
Query advanced Statcast data with filtering, sorting, and video highlight links.
- **Parameters:**
  - `start_date` (required): Start date in YYYY-MM-DD format
  - `end_date` (required): End date in YYYY-MM-DD format
  - `result` (optional): Filter by outcome (e.g., "home_run", "single", "double")
  - `min_ev` (optional): Minimum exit velocity filter
  - `min_pitch_velo` (optional): Minimum pitch velocity filter
  - `sort_by` (optional): Sort metric - "exit_velocity" (default), "distance", or "launch_angle"
  - `limit` (optional): Number of results (default: 10)
  - `order` (optional): Sort order - "desc" (default) or "asc"
- **Returns:** Detailed play-by-play data with video links

### üé• Video Highlights Integration

Every result from `statcast_leaderboard` includes multiple video access points:

```json
"video_links": {
  "game_highlights_url": "https://www.mlb.com/gameday/745890/video",
  "film_room_search": "https://www.mlb.com/video/search?q=Ronald+Acuna+Jr.+2024-07-20",
  "game_pk": "745890",
  "api_highlights_endpoint": "https://statsapi.mlb.com/api/v1/schedule?gamePk=745890&hydrate=game(content(highlights(highlights)))"
}
```

### üèüÔ∏è Smart Team Recognition

The server intelligently handles team names:
- Full names: "Orioles" ‚Üí "BAL", "Red Sox" ‚Üí "BOS"
- Cities: "Boston" ‚Üí "BOS", "New York Yankees" ‚Üí "NYY"
- Historical teams: "Expos" ‚Üí "MON", "Indians" ‚Üí "CLE"
- All 30 current MLB teams supported with common variations

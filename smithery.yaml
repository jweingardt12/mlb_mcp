runtime: container
# The command to start the server (e.g., Uvicorn) should now be in your Dockerfile's CMD or ENTRYPOINT.
# Smithery will expect the server to listen on the $PORT environment variable.
# Example startCommand structure for HTTP, if further configuration schema is needed later:
# startCommand:
#   type: "http"
#   configSchema: 
#     type: "object"
#     properties: {}
#   exampleConfig: {}
